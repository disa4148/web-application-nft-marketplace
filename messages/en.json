If you are an NFT artist or collector, Ethereum is the perfect tool due to its reliable infrastructure and active community. Ethereum is also transitioning to a more energy-efficient mechanism, Proof of Stake (PoS). Ethereum was developed by Vitalik Buterin and a team of programmers. The project is governed by the Ethereum Foundation, an independent organization supporting the network's development. The ecosystem uses its own cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH)."

There are many practical applications for this technology. For example, artists create digital art and sell it. This is similar to buying stickers or virtual gifts online. Sometimes, authors give their creations additional practical value. Some NFTs act as tickets to exclusive clubs, some can be a resource or skin in a game, while others serve as documents proving ownership of something in the real world."

In addition, wallets are used as a way to interact with projects on the blockchain. For example, to authenticate in Getgems, to mint, buy, and sell NFTs, you need to have a wallet. Don't worry, we don't have access to your coins, they are safe. There are many different wallets for ETH. We recommend using Metamask."
