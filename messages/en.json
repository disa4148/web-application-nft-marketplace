          "description": "NFT (Non-fungible token) - is a non-interchangeable token, a digital contract, a 'marker' indicating who owns the digital work and its creator. There are many ways to apply this technology in practice. For example, artists create digital art and sell it. This is similar to buying stickers or virtual gifts online. Sometimes authors endow their creativity with additional practical value. Some NFTs act as tickets to exclusive clubs, some can be some resource or skin in a game, others act as a document proving the right to ownership of something in the real world."

In addition, wallets are used as a way to interact with projects on the blockchain. For example, to log in to Getgems, mint, buy and sell NFTs, you need to have a wallet. Don't worry, we don't have access to your coins, they are safe. There are many different wallets for TON. We recommend using Tonkeeper or Tonhub."
